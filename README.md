# Implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm

An algorithm designed to find the longest common subsequence of two strings. 

## Usage

This is a command line utility. 

To build: 

`go build longest-common-subsequence.go`

To run: 

`./longest-common-subsequence <first string><second string>`
